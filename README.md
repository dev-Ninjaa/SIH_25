## 🎯 Problem Statement

### **SIH 2025 Challenge #25051**

**Organization:** Government of Odisha | **Department:** Electronics & IT Department

> **Challenge:** Develop an IoT-based monitoring system for solar or wind microgrids in rural areas, providing real-time data on energy generation, storage, and consumption. The system should alert users to inefficiencies or maintenance needs.

#### **Current Pain Points:**
- 🔴 **25-40% energy waste** in isolated rural microgrids
- 📊 **No real-time visibility** into system performance
- ⚡ **Manual monitoring** leading to reactive maintenance
- 🏘️ **No coordination** between neighboring households
- 💰 **$500-1000 annual losses** per household due to inefficiency

#### **Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Hardware-software prototype improving **microgrid efficiency by 15%**
- 📱 Mobile app for community operators
- 🌐 Real-time monitoring and alert system
- 🔧 Predictive maintenance capabilities

## 🌟 Our Solution: Intelligent Energy Communities

### **🚀 Beyond Traditional Monitoring - We Enable Energy Sharing**

While the problem asks for monitoring, we've innovated a **community-based peer-to-peer energy sharing system** that goes beyond traditional solutions:

<div align="center">

```
🏠 Household A (Surplus) ⚡→ 🏠 Household B (Deficit)
     ↓ Automated Detection    ↓ Priority Allocation
🔋 Battery >80%              🏥 Critical Loads First
```

</div>

#### **🎯 Core Features:**
- **⚡ Real-time Monitoring** - Live energy generation, storage & consumption tracking
- **🔄 Automated Energy Sharing** - P2P energy transfer between households
- **📊 Web Dashboard** - Comprehensive management interface  
- **🚨 Smart Alerts** - Predictive maintenance notifications
- **🤖 AI Analytics** - Battery health prediction & optimization

#### **💡 Innovation Beyond Requirements [we are trying!!]:**
1. **Community Energy Sharing** - First-of-its-kind P2P energy trading
2. **Priority-based Distribution** - Critical loads (hospitals, schools) get priority
3. **Predictive Analytics** - AI-driven maintenance and efficiency optimization
4. **Mobile-first Design** - PWA for offline accessibility in rural areas
5. **Blockchain Integration** - Transparent energy transaction logging
